# Inventory Application for The Odin Project

## Objective

The objecctive was to use the skills I've learned so far to create an inventory application that can be used to track items within a databse.

## Example

For a live version of the app go to: https://pokemon-inventory-production.up.railway.app/

## Reflection

Building on top of the mini message board project, I definitely learned more about using various npm libraries to achieve certain results. My main takeaways were how to improve workflow during the production process, mainly between using postcss, tailwind, prettier plugins, and nodemon to allow for faster development during the design phase.

The setup of the project definitely has a lot of steps and I'll most likely have to refer to this project more in the future if I want to startup more projects with a background structure like this.
